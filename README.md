## 🚀 How It Works
The user enters a city name in the input box.

JavaScript fetches weather data (if you connected it to an API).

The page displays temperature and weather conditions.

The background image changes based on the current time (using morning.png, afternoon.png, evening.png, and night.png).

## 💡 Key Concepts
DOM manipulation with JavaScript
